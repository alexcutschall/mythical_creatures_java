Mythical Creatures

A collection of simple exercises to practice Java and JUnit.

This is an identical version to a set of exercises that I completed
during my time at the coding bootcamp Turing School of Software and
Design and all credit goes to them for the design of the classes
and tests.

I created this because of how helpful it was for me in learning Ruby
and I thought it could be helpful for someone just getting into
Java and JUnit. 

Enjoy!
